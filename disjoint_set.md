A disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection \\(\mathcal{S} = \\{S_{1}, S_{2}, \dots, S_{k}\\}\\) of disjoint dynamic sets.

## A weighted-union heuristic

### Theorem 1
Using linked-list representation of disjoint sets and the weighted union heuristic, a sequence of \\(m\\) MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, \\(n\\) of which are MAKE-SET operations, takes, \\(O(m + n \lg{n})\\) time.
